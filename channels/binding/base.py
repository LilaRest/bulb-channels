    Represents a two-way data binding from channels/groups to a Django model.
    Outgoing binding sends model events to zero or more groups.
    Incoming binding takes messages and maybe applies the action based on perms.

    To implement outbound, implement:
     - group_names, which returns a list of group names to send to
     - serialize, which returns message contents from an instance + action

    To implement inbound, implement:
     - deserialize, which returns pk, data and action from message contents
     - has_permission, which says if the user can do the action on an instance
     - create, which takes the data and makes a model instance
     - update, which takes data and a model instance and applies one to the other

    Outbound will work once you implement the functions; inbound requires you
    to place one or more bindings inside a protocol-specific Demultiplexer
    and tie that in as a consumer.
