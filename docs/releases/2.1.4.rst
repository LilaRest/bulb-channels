2.1.4 Release Notes
===================

Channels 2.1.4 is another bugfix release in the 2.1 series.


Bugfixes & Small Changes
------------------------

* Django middleware is now cached rather than instantiated per request
  resulting in a sigificant speed improvement. Some middleware took seconds to
  load and as a result Channels was unusable for HTTP serving before.

* ChannelServerLiveTestCase now serves static files again.

* Improved error message resulting from bad Origin headers.

* ``runserver`` logging now goes through the Django logging framework to match
  modern Django.

* Generic consumers can now have non-default channel layers - set the
  ``channel_layer_alias`` property on the consumer class

* Improved error when accessing ``scope['user']`` before it's ready - the user
  is not accessible in the constructor of ASGI apps as it needs an async
  environment to load in. Previously it raised a generic error when you tried to
  access it early; now it tells you more clearly what's happening.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
