2.4.0 Release Notes
===================

Channels 2.4 brings compatibility with Django 3.0s ``async_unsafe()`` checks.
(Specifically we ensure session save calls are made inside an asgiref
``database_sync_to_async()``.)

If you are using Daphne, it is recommended that you install Daphne version
2.4.1 or later for full compatibility with Django 3.0.

Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

In line with the guidance provided by Django's supported versions policy we now
also drop support for all Django versions before 2.2, which is the current LTS.
