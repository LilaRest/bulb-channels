2.0.2 Release Notes
===================

Channels 2.0.2 is a patch release of Channels, fixing a bug in the database
connection handling.

As always, when updating Channels make sure to also update its dependencies
(``asgiref`` and ``daphne``) as these also get their own bugfix updates, and
some bugs that may appear to be part of Channels are actually in those packages.


New Features
------------

* There is a new ``channels.db.database_sync_to_async`` wrapper that is like
  ``sync_to_async`` but also closes database connections for you. You can
  read more about usage in :doc:`/topics/databases`.


Bugfixes
--------

* SyncConsumer and all its descendant classes now close database connections
  when they exit.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
