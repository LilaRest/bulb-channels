2.1.7 Release Notes
===================

Channels 2.1.7 is another bugfix release in the 2.1 series, and the last
release (at least for a long while) with Andrew Godwin as the primary
maintainer.

Thanks to everyone who has used, supported, and contributed to Channels over
the years, and I hope we can keep it going with community support for a good
while longer.


Bugfixes & Small Changes
------------------------

* HTTP request body size limit is now enforced (the one set by the
  ``DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`` setting)

* ``database_sync_to_async`` now closes old connections before it runs code,
  which should prevent some connection errors in long-running pages or tests.

* The auth middleware closes old connections before it runs, to solve similar
  old-connection issues.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
