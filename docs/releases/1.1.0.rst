1.1.0 Release Notes
===================

.. note::
    The 1.1.0 release is still in development.

Channels 1.1.0 introduces a couple of major but backwards-compatible changes.
It was released on UNKNOWN.

Major Changes
-------------

* Test classes have been moved from ``channels.tests`` to ``channels.test``
  to better match Django. Old imports from ``channels.tests`` will continue to
  work but will trigger a deprecation warning, and ``channels.tests`` will be
  removed completely in version 1.3.

Minor Changes & Bugfixes
------------------------

* Bindings now support non-integer fields for primary keys on models

* The ``enforce_ordering`` decorator no longer suffers a race condition where
  it would drop messages under high load


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
