2.0.1 Release Notes
===================

Channels 2.0.1 is a patch release of channels, adding a couple of small
new features and fixing one bug in URL resolution.

As always, when updating Channels make sure to also update its dependencies
(``asgiref`` and ``daphne``) as these also get their own bugfix updates, and
some bugs that may appear to be part of Channels are actually in those packages.


New Features
------------

* There are new async versions of the Websocket generic consumers,
  ``AsyncWebsocketConsumer`` and ``AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer``. Read more
  about them in :doc:`/topics/consumers`.

* The old ``allowed_hosts_only`` decorator has been removed (it was
  accidentally included in the 2.0 release but didn't work) and replaced with
  a new ``OriginValidator`` and ``AllowedHostsOriginValidator`` set of
  ASGI middleware. Read more in :doc:`/topics/security`.


Bugfixes
--------

* A bug in ``URLRouter`` which didn't allow you to match beyond the first
  URL in some situations has been resolved, and a test suite was added for
  URL resolution to prevent it happening again.


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

None.
