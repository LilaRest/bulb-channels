Support
=======

If you have questions about Channels, need debugging help or technical support, you can turn to community resources like:

- `Stack Overflow <https://www.stackoverflow.com>`_
- The `Django Users mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-users>`_ (django-users@googlegroups.com)

If you have a concrete bug or feature request (one that is clear and actionable), please file an issue against the
appropriate GitHub project.

Unfortunately, if you open a GitHub issue with a vague problem (like "it's slow!" or "connections randomly drop!")
we'll have to close it as we don't have the volunteers to answer the number of questions we'd get - please go to
one of the other places above for support from the community at large.

As a guideline, your issue is concrete enough to open an issue if you can provide **exact steps to reproduce** in a fresh,
example project. We need to be able to reproduce it on a *normal, local developer machine* - so saying something doesn't
work in a hosted environment is unfortunately not very useful to us, and we'll close the issue and point you here.

Apologies if this comes off as harsh, but please understand that open source maintenance and support takes up a lot
of time, and if we answered all the issues and support requests there would be no time left to actually work on the code
itself!

How to help
-----------

If you'd like to help us with support, the first thing to do is to provide support in the communities mentioned at the
top (Stack Overflow and the mailing list).

If you'd also like to help triage issues, please get in touch and mention you'd like to help out and we can make sure you're
set up and have a good idea of what to do. Most of the work is making sure incoming issues are actually valid and actionable,
and closing those that aren't and redirecting them to this page politely and explaining why.

Some sample response templates are below.
