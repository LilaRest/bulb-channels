Contributing
============

If you're looking to contribute to Channels, then please read on - we encourage
contributions both large and small, from both novice and seasoned developers.


What can I work on?
-------------------

We're looking for help with the following areas:

 * Documentation and tutorial writing
 * Bugfixing and testing
 * Feature polish and occasional new feature design
 * Case studies and writeups

You can find what we're looking to work on right now in two places:

 * Specific bugs are in the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/andrewgodwin/channels/issues>`_
 * Higher-level tasks are on the `ChannelsTasks Django wiki page <https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/ChannelsTasks>`_

These are, however, just a suggested list - any offer to help is welcome as long
as it fits the project goals.


I'm interested, how should I get started?
-----------------------------------------

The best thing to do is to see if there's a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/andrewgodwin/channels/issues>`_
for the thing you wish to work on - if there is, leave a comment saying you're
going to take it on, and if not, open one describing what you're doing so there's
a place to record information around.

If you have questions, you can either open an issue with the questions detailed,
hop on the ``#django-channels`` channel on Freenode IRC, or email Andrew directly
at ``andrew@aeracode.org``.


I'm a novice contributor/developer - can I help?
------------------------------------------------

Of course - just get in touch like above and mention your experience level,
and we'll try the best we can to match you up with someone to mentor you through
the task.


Can you pay me for my time?
---------------------------

Thanks to Mozilla, we have a reasonable budget to pay people for their time
working on all of the above sorts of tasks and more. If you're interested in
working on something and being paid, you'll need to draw up a short proposal
and get it approved first - the wiki page above has more details, and if you're
interested, email andrew@aeracode.org to get the conversation started.
