Django Channels
===============

Channels is a project that takes Django and extends its abilities beyond
HTTP - to handle WebSockets, chat protocols, IoT protocols, and more.

It does this by taking the core of Django and layering a fully asynchronous
layer underneath, running Django itself in a synchronous mode but handling
connections and sockets asynchronously, and giving you the choice to write
in either style.

To get started understanding how Channels works, read our :doc:`introduction`,
which will walk through how things work. If you're upgrading from Channels 1,
take a look at :doc:`one-to-two` to get an overview of the changes; things
are substantially different.

.. warning::
   This is incomplete documentation for an upcoming release. If you are looking
   for documentation for the stable release of Channels, please select "stable"
   in the bottom-left corner of the page.
